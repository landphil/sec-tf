# tf_app_setup
## Terraform module to Set up AWS infrastructure for a VPC containing an EC2 instance running an Nginx Web server.
### Setup Instructions
**See the `README.md` in the root directory for general Terraform and AWS setup**

**NOTE** The `aws_init_setup` module must be run before this modules to set up the S3 state storage and DynamoDB locking

You will need to have an EC2 keypair for SSH access to the webserver instance. Currently the keypair defaults to `phil-ec2-nva`.

To create a new keypair, see the instructions at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html

### Terraform Variables
These are the variables that you may wish to override through the command line or override files 
(see Terraform documentation for how to override variables or https://amazic.com/overriding-variables-in-terraform/)

```
variable "aws_region" {
  description = "Region to deploy infrastructure"
  type        = string
  default     = "us-east-1"
}

variable "ssh_access_cidr" {
  description = "Allowed source IP addresses for SSH access to the webserver instance"
  type        = list
  default     = ["76.209.242.132/32"]
}

variable "key_name" {
  description = "EC2 Keypair for SSH access to the instance"
  type        = string
  default     = "phil-ec2-nva"
}
```

### Deploy and Management Instructions
The deployment and management for this module follows the standard Terraform procedure:
```
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
and to destroy the infrastructure
```
terraform destroy
```
### Testing the deploy
Once `terraform apply` has completed, it will return the output value `webserver_public_ip`. Open a browser; then go to the address http://`webserver_public_ip`

So, if the output is:
```
Apply complete! Resources: 26 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

webserver_public_ip = "3.84.140.161"
```
navigate to `http://3.84.140.161`

The page content should be:

**Hello, Terraform!**
